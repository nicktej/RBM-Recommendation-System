# Movie Recommendation System

This is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) used to recommend movies! It is a very cool unsupervised learning AI, and I would recommend anyone interested to read up on Boltzmann Machines. A good article on the topic: https://skymind.ai/wiki/restricted-boltzmann-machine.

I achieved an accuracy of 0.75, meaning 3/4 movies are recommended correctly.

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need  PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
